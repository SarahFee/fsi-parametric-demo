**If we can predict crises, why not funding?**

---

## Problem

Humanitarian organizations can forecast floods, droughts, and displacement — but not their own funding.

* In Sudan, average delays grew from 50 → 240 days in one year.
* In Ukraine, funding volatility tripled.
* Across multiple crises, billions in pledges never reach the ground.

The result: disrupted food aid, broken health services, and service restart costs that are 2–3 times higher than continuity.

## Solution

**Funding Stress Index (FSI)** — a new metric to quantify donor-driven risk.

When thresholds are breached, **parametric insurance** activates:

* Donor Insurance → cushions disbursement delays
* Plan Insurance → stabilizes country-level gaps
* Project Insurance → protects frontline operations

**Impact:** Simulations show 40–99% gap reduction in crisis settings.

## Vision

A humanitarian finance system where:

* Agencies can plan with confidence
* Donors can adjust without creating collapse
* Funding becomes as predictable as crisis models

SolferinTech is not about replacing aid. It’s about giving it a safety net.
